*SPRAWL Voices* is a composition for tape and an arbitrary number of instruments.
It is based on the  1990 documentary `Cyberpunk <https://youtu.be/UdvxPlhTjDU>`_ by `Marianne Schaefer Trench <http://marianneschaefertrench.com/>`_.
With a total length of 60 minutes, the tape part defines a temporal structure, dividing the piece into 5 movements of distinct character. The tape part is active between and within the movements and features interviews from the documentary. It is used for additional processing, but voice samples should be intelligible and the movements should be clearly separated.
