Concept
-------

The graphical score ‘DISCOUNT’ (2017-2018) is a collage across 30 pages, compiled from the advertising brochures of discount supermarkets, respectively food items. The score, realized on paper with glue, organizes these cut out objects along a strict time grid, with additional columns for the assignment of voices.

Mixed Version
-------------

 8 modular synthesizer voices from previous performances of the EOC is played back from tape. Four additional voices are added live by acoustical instruments (Korean Percussion, Gayaguem, Daegum,  Haegum). These sources are then mixed and spatialized in real time.
