The Electronic Orchestra Charlottenburg (EOC) explores the improvisation and
interpretation of Electroacoustic Music. This includes the interaction of
diverse electronic instruments and their spatialization in real time. The EOC
was founded at the |electronic_music_studio| at |tu-berlin| within a seminar of
the |ak|. It offers a platform for developing and applying new instruments and
concepts in the realm of electroacoustic music. Currently it consists of ten
participants, among whom are students and alumni of different backgrounds as
well as external musicians.

The Electronic Orchestra Charlottenburg (EOC) consists of a group of electronic
and/or electro-acoustic musicians and programmers. Its sound is dispersed over
multi-channel systems with the help of spatial rendering techniques such as
ambisonics.
