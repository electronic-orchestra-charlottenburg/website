- Text-based score for ensemble by Robert Stokowy, 2019
- Commissioned version for Electronic Orchestra Charlottenburg

*BLODGETT IS A TEXT-BASED SCORE FOR ENSEMBLE. THE  PIECE  IS TO  BE  PERFORMED  IN A  PURELY  SONIC  BUT  NOT  MUSICAL  MANNER. ALL  INTUITIVE  IDEAS  OF  PITCH,  RHYTHM,  CHORD  PROGRESSION AND OTHER TRADITIONAL TRAINING ARE TO BE LEFT OUT. THIS PIECE IS FOCUSSING ON NOTIONS OF MINIMALISM AND A RADICAL REDUCTION OF PERFORMATIVE MEANS.  ACCORDING TO THE SCORE, EACH WORD, EACH CONNECTION OF WORDS, EACH LINE AND THE PIECE AS A WHOLE HOLD VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT  HOW THE  PIECE  SOUNDS. THE  PERFORMERS ARE ASKED TO  USE THE TEXT  IN  CONNECTION WITH THE  COMPOSER’S  NOTES AND TIMELINE TO PLAY THE PIECE. INSTEAD OF USING SPECIFIC MUSICAL NOTE VALUES, THE PERFORMERS CAN USE THEIR SUBJECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TEXT. THIS ALSO REQUIRES AN IN-DEPTH INTERACTION & REFLECTION WITH/OF THE TEXT.  THE  PIECE  IS TO  BE  PERFORMED  QUIET  (ppp  -  mf) EVEN  IF THE AUDIENCE  IS  NOISY,  REMAIN  SUBTLE AND  QUIET;  SUBTLETY  IS  KEY;  LET  GO  OF ANY INDIVIDUAL INTENTION TO ADD MORE; THERE ARE NO SOLOS AND NO TUTTIS; NEGATIVE SPACE IS A MAIN MOTIF (TIME-WISE & SONICALLY); LET GO OF ANY MUSICAL TRADITION OR INTENTIONALITY, THIS PIECE IS A ANTI-STATEMENT TO THE INSTITUTIONAL IDEA OF ERNSTE MUSIK. INSTEAD  OF  PRODUCING  A FULL AND  STABLE  SOUND  YOU  ARE  ASKED  TO  REDUCE  YOUR  OWN  CONTRIBUTION  RADICALLY.  THAT  IS,  USE  YOUR INSTRUMENT TO MERELY PRODUCE FRAGILE FRAGMENTS (BARELY ABLE TO EXIST ON THEIR OWN), SONIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT MERGE WITH THE SOUND-FRAGMENTS PRODUCED BY OTHERS. TOGETHER YOU FORM SOUNDS AND THE SONIC STRUCTURAL NARRATIVE OF THIS PIECE. DON’T BE AFRAID OF NEGATIVE SPACE AND MINIMAL ACTION. TOGETHER THEY BECOME MORE MEANINGFUL & SIGNIFICANT, THE MORE YOU DARE TO REDUCE THEM.* (From the score)
