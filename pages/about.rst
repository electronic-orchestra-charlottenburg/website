The Electronic Orchestra Charlottenburg (EOC) explores the improvisation and
interpretation of Electroacoustic Music. This includes the interaction of
diverse electronic instruments and their spatialization in real time. The EOC
was founded at the |electronic_music_studio| at |tu-berlin| within a seminar of
the |ak|. It offers a platform for developing and applying
new instruments and concepts in the realm of electroacoustic music.

The EOC consists of a group of electronic and/or electro-acoustic musicians and
programmers. Its sound is dispersed over multi-channel systems with the help of
spatial rendering techniques such as ambisonics.
